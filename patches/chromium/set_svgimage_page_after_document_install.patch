Subject: Set SVGImage::page_ after document install
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

We can end up having the associated ImageResource call
SVGImage::ResetAnimation() before the Document has been associated with
the SVGImage's LocalFrame, but after the link to the initial Document
was severed, if a GC is triggered within that window and ends up
collecting the last observer of the ImageResource.

By assigning |SVGImage::page_| after the installing the document, we
close this hole since SVGImage::RootElement() (called by
SVGImage::ResetAnimation()) will now observe a null Page and return null
without attempting to dereference the document.
